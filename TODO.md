# keyboard-analysis-tools

## keyboard_logger
* adjust ergodox connection to loop through all possible options and check for successful connections (current string check is not flexible enough and changes on a computer-to-computer basis).
* increase obfuscation strength by appending to file after random character length
* get rid of global variables and use classes
* add directory argument
* add filename argument
* timestamp files on exit

##  generate_heatmap
* option to generate images for all layers
* setup default reference layer (so keycounts of 0 still show up)
